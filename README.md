gchat conversation visualizer
=============================

Some flaky scripts to log and visualize your chat history via gchat.

Allow permissions on these bash scripts:

    chmod +x getchats.sh
    chmod +x batch_convert.sh

Then run the script:

    ./getchats.sh

You will be prompted to enter your gmail email address and password. The final data will be downloaded to the file called "analyzed".
